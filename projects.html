					<p class="headline">Synthesizer cpp</p>

					<p>I while back when I was still using windows 10 I wrote an synthesizer in cpp with sinewaves and envelopes and all tthe good stuff. I did this because I was bored one night and I found a fun course on youtube and kind of build on that. Because I wrote it in Windows 10(and because I am lazy) it only works in the windows terminal. But I like it anyway.</p>

					<p class="headline">Physics based platformer</p>

					<p>When I was still using Unity I wrote a few games and a million tech demos because I wasn't interested in game design or art. What I did like was coding, so I wrote a 2D platformer focused on physics. I took my 2-4 months to write, with(almost) everyday 3 hours of work. It is the tech demo of which I am the most proud of.</p>

					<p class="headline">My OS</p>

					<p>At the moment I am running GNU/Linux. My goto distro is Fedora I love Fedora it is professional, super stable, it has a great package manager, I think it is the best distro for professionals and beginners, so if you're thinking about making the leap to linux go for fedora.</p>
